# openwrt on macbook

Here I wrote the documents which collects the information and experieces that I
gained when I played with OpenWRT.

Since I am playing in Mac. Below is for user who is using OSX but it is
believed that most operation are common for Linux as well.

- [How to Build on Mac](build.md)
- [How to run on QEMU](run-on-qemu.md)
- [Local package repository](local-ipkg-repo.md)
- [Resolve baresip issue](baresip_issue.md)
- [Feeds version control](feeds.md)
- [missing dependency when adding a new package](new-package.md)
- [baresip-mod-pulse](patch_baresip-mod-pulse.diff)
- [pulse audio in lede/openwrt](pulse-auido.md)
- [run baresip](run-baresip.md)
- [baresip with pulseaudio with pulse-simple interface](pulse-simple.md)
- [tun/tap](tun-tap.md)
- [ssh to lede](sh.md)
- [NAT on osx](nat.md)
- [play a file to pulse audio source](play.md)

if you want to play with crosstool-NG, here is the [document](crosstool-NG.md)
I wrote for your reference.

# lede on Linux

Eventually due to an issue that I could not bypass (and compiler issue), I
install a VM on mac and start playing lede/openwrt project in Linux
